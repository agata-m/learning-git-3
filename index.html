            <p>I've been grinding so long, been trying this shit for years<br>
                And I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here<br>
                And if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain<br>But I've been sending up prayers and something's changed
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">I think I finally found my hallelujah<br>I've been waiting for this moment all my life<br>
                Now all my dreams are coming true, ya<br>I've been waiting for this moment<br><br>
                And it's good to be alive right about now<br>Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now<br>
                Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now<br>
                Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say yeah<br>
                It's good to be alive right about now
            </p>
            <p>I was dead in the water, nobody wanted me (Uh huh)<br>
                I was old news, I went cold as cold can be<br>
                But I kept throwing on coal tryna make that fire burn (Uh huh)<br>
                Sometimes you gotta get scars to get what you deserve (Uh huh)<br>
                I kept moving on and now I'm moving up (Uh huh)<br>
                Damn, I'm feeling blessed with all this love
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">I think I finally found my hallelujah<br>I've been waiting for this moment all my life<br>
                Now all my dreams are coming true, ya<br>I've been waiting for this moment<br><br>
                And it's good to be alive right about now<br>Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now<br>
                Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now<br>
                Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say yeah<br>
                It's good to be alive right about now
            </p>
            <p>
                I almost can-, cannot handle it<br>
                I could get u-, could get used to this<br>
                I almost can-, cannot handle it<br>
                I could get u-, could get used to this
